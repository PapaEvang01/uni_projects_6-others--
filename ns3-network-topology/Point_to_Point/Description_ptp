🔌 P2P with CSMA – First Taste of Network Topology in NS-3
This project offers a first hands-on experience with network topology simulation using NS-3. 
It combines a Point-to-Point (P2P) connection with a CSMA-based Ethernet LAN, showcasing how different types of network links interact in a hybrid environment.

📡 Topology Overview
A P2P link connects two core nodes (n0 and n1)

Node n1 also acts as a bridge to a CSMA LAN with 20+ additional nodes

A UDP Echo Server is placed on node n0

A UDP Echo Client is placed on the last CSMA node (e.g., n21)

Traffic flows from the LAN across the P2P link to reach the server

⚙️ Configuration Highlights
P2P Link: 14 Mbps, 10 ms delay

CSMA LAN: 10 Mbps, 25.6 µs delay

UDP Echo: 10 packets of 1024 bytes, 1-second interval

🧪 What This Demonstrates
Basic NS-3 simulation setup

Mixing different network technologies (point-to-point & Ethernet)

Automatic routing and packet tracing

Simple application-level testing of connectivity
