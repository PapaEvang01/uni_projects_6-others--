📡 NS-3 TCP Simulation: DropTail vs RED Queuing

This project simulates a custom network topology in NS-3 using C++ to compare the behavior of two different queuing disciplines: 
DropTail (default) and RED (Random Early Detection).

The simulation models a simple 4-node topology with TCP bulk senders and a shared bottleneck link. It monitors TCP congestion window evolution 
and received bytes to evaluate performance under different queue management strategies.
