NS-3 Network Simulation Projects
================================

This repository contains two beginner-friendly NS-3 simulations that explore basic
network topologies and queuing behavior.

----------------------------------------
Project 1: P2P with CSMA – Intro to Topology
----------------------------------------
Simulates a hybrid network:
- Point-to-point link between n0 and n1
- CSMA LAN with 20+ nodes connected via n1
- UDP Echo Server on node n0
- UDP Echo Client on the last CSMA node (e.g., n21)

Goal: Understand how point-to-point and Ethernet (CSMA) links interact
in a basic network topology.

-----------------------------------------------
Project 2: TCP Simulation – DropTail vs RED Queue
-----------------------------------------------
Simulates a 4-node TCP scenario:
- Bulk TCP traffic from A and B to D via router C
- Tests DropTail vs RED (Random Early Detection) queuing at the C–D link

Files:
- original.cc → DropTail queue
- red.cc      → RED AQM with custom parameters

Goal: Compare congestion control behavior and throughput between
basic tail-drop queues and active queue management.
