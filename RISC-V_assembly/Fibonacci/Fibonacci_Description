üßÆ Fibonacci Sequence in RISC-V Assembly

This project implements a simple command-line program in RISC-V Assembly that calculates and prints the Fibonacci sequence up to a user-defined number of terms.
It was designed as a compact exercise to practice register manipulation, looping, and basic I/O using the RISC-V ecall interface.

Upon execution, the program:

Prompts the user to enter an integer n

Prints the first n terms of the Fibonacci sequence (starting from 1)

This project demonstrates key low-level programming concepts such as conditional branching, arithmetic operations, 
and using system calls for interactive input/output. It‚Äôs a great example of how classic algorithms can be expressed at the assembly level on the RISC-V architecture.

üíª Tools used: RARS or Venus RISC-V simulator
üõ†Ô∏è Topics: branching, integer registers, syscall interface, arithmetic loops
