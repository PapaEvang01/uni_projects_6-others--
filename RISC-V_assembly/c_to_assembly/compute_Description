ðŸŸ¢ Row Sum in RISC-V Assembly

This project showcases a low-level implementation of a classic C function that computes the row-wise sum of a 2D array, rewritten entirely in RISC-V Assembly.
It's a simple but effective demonstration of memory manipulation, control structures, and array traversal using the RISC-V instruction set.

Originally developed as part of a university systems programming lab, this project reflects a strong grasp of hardware-level logic and instruction sequencing.
Itâ€™s ideal for anyone exploring assembly-level computation, embedded systems, or learning how high-level operations translate to low-level instructions.

ðŸ”§ Tools used: RARS / Venus (RISC-V emulator)
ðŸ“Œ Key skills: Register usage, pointer arithmetic, nested loops, 2D memory layout
