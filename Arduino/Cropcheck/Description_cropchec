# ðŸŒ¾ CropCheck - Smart Agriculture Monitoring Device

**CropCheck** is a portable, Arduino-based prototype developed for **AgriTech, Inc.** to monitor and evaluate crop conditions in real time.  
The device combines multiple sensors and outputs to provide farmers with fast, visual, and tactile feedback about environmental conditions and seed quality.

## âœ… Core Functionalities

### T1. Environmental Monitoring  
- Monitors **ambient light**, **temperature**, and **humidity** every 5 seconds.  
- Displays readings via the **Serial Monitor**.  
- Compares sensor values against **predefined thresholds** stored in persistent memory.

### T2. Data Visualization  
- A **30-LED RGB strip** provides intuitive visual feedback:  
  â€¢ **LEDs 0â€“2** indicate the active sensor (light, temperature, humidity)  
  â€¢ **LEDs 11â€“20** show proportional value levels  
  â€¢ **Color-coded alerts**:
    - ðŸŸ© Green: Value within range  
    - ðŸŸ¨ Yellow: Below minimum threshold  
    - ðŸ”´ Blinking Red: Above maximum threshold  

### T3. Seed Evaluation Mode  
- A **touch sensor** triggers a **servo-operated lid** to insert seeds.  
- A **vibration motor** shakes the seeds with strength controlled by a **potentiometer**.  
- The **LED strip pulses green** in intensity during the shaking process.  
- When the potentiometer is reset to 0, the lid reopens automatically.

### T4. Distance Alert System  
- An **ultrasonic sensor** detects obstacles ahead.  
- If an object is within **30 cm**, the system enters alert mode:
  - The **vibration motor** activates
  - **All LEDs blink red**
  - The **servo motor is temporarily disabled** during this alert to avoid interference

## ðŸ”§ Code Structure

To keep the implementation modular, the system is split into two Arduino sketch files:

- `CropCheck_T1_T2.ino`: Handles environmental monitoring and LED-based visualization  
- `CropCheck_T3_T4.ino`: Handles seed evaluation and distance alert functionality
